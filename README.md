Devs in the ditch: Unikernels and Mirage OS slides
==================================================

Here's my slides from my talk at Devs in the Ditch: http://www.meetup.com/devs-in-the-ditch/events/221972483/

You can look at the slides here: http://mattgray.github.io/devsintheditch-unikernel-talk/

The slides are in the gh-pages branch here: https://github.com/mattgray/devsintheditch-unikernel-talk/tree/gh-pages

The examples from the talk are in this repo - they are adapted from https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton - look here for many more examples

http://openmirage.org/ should be your first port of call for finding out more.

I'm going to publish these slides as a unikernel soon, possibly making use of the mirage-seal tool: https://github.com/mirage/mirage-seal, I'l write about how I did it when I get around to it.
